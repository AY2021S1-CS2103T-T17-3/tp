## Project: CANdidates

CANdidates is a powerful contact management desktop App optimised for job recruiters to manage job applicants.
The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 25 kLoC.

### Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Ability to find candidates by specific fields.
  * What it does: Enables the user to find candidates with fields that contain specified keywords.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a typical job recruiter has many candidates to handle, this feature will provide a convenient way for them to look for suitable candidates that fulfil a certain criteria and streamline their search.
  * Highlights: This enhancement was challenging as it requires chaining of various predicates, based on the fields specified by the user, to achieve the desired outcome. An in-depth understanding of the code base and its logic flow are required due to the numerous other classes involved.
